The large number of our population has become one of the most serious problems of our society. According to a recent survey of the National Bureau of Statistics, there are more than 1.3 billion people in our country, which account for about 1/5 of all the people in the world. The same survey also predicts that our population will grow quickly in the years to come.

Overpopulation has brought about a series of negative effects to our economic development and social security. In the first place, too many people impose a heavy burden on our environment. As a result, we suffer from a shortage of fresh water and natural resources. In the second place, as the supply of labor greatly exceeds the demand of the society, many people become employed. This is a source of social unrest. Last but not least, we have to manufacture all kinds of products to meet the needs of the people, which causes environment pollution to our lakes and land.

Serious though the problem seems, we have to take some measures to tackle it. On the one hand, the government should carry out more strictly the policy of family planning, thus reducing the total number of population. On the other hand, all the people should realize the harms of overpopulation. With the concerted efforts of all the parties concerned, we are sure to solve the problem in the future.
